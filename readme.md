We plan to add more features in the future. In the meantime if you are interested in contributing to this project, please feel free to fork the repository and make a pull request. We are looking forward to your contribution. There will be a lot more countries added to the project in the future.

# For developers

Each project in the packages folder is an npm package.

How to run a project:

```
cd packages/<project>
```

install:

    ```
    npm i
    ```

start:

    ```
    npm run start
    ```

The project will be served on port 3000. Each project has a demo folder which can be used to see how the project works.

### Credit

I would like to thank [simple maps](https://simplemaps.com/resources/svg-maps) for the open source SVG maps.
